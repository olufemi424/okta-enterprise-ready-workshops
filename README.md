# Okta Enterprise Ready Workshops

This repository contains the base application for the OktaDev enterprise ready workshops. Take your SaaS apps to the next level in the identity maturity journey with these series of workshops. 

From the base application, you'll learn how to add the features you need to your SaaS app in order to land enterprise-level customers.

> This repository should not be used as a template for production ready code. It is intentionally simplistic and minimal so you can focus on the topics covered in the workshop content.

The base application is a minimal "todo list" application, built as a B2C application. There are four workshops that take this base application and enhances it for your enterprise customers:

1. **Onboarding your customers with OIDC** - Enable your customers to bring their own [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) server to sign in to your applicatio using an industry-standard authentication mechanism.
2. **Sync all your customer's users with SCIM** - Give your app the complete picture of your customer's user base using [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](https://scim.cloud/).
3. **Add automated reporting with no-code Okta Workflows** - Enable your customers to automate actions within your app using a low/no-code configuration mechanism.
4. **Automate Okta management with Terraform** - Automate environment creation and ensure consistency in managing your Okta organization using Terraform.

The Terraform workshop is independent. The OIDC workshop adds multi-tenancy required for the SCIM and Okta Workflows workshops. Choose the workshops that best address your next most pressing need.

## About this application

This application is a [React](https://react.dev/) frontend and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) API backend using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM over [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. The entire project is in a [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev/).

Depending on the specific workshop you're participating in, you may need some knowledge of JavaScript, REST concepts, and command line operations.

**Prerequisites**

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) v18
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v9 (Installs automatically with Node and includes `npx`)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

The application was built using Node v18.14.0, npm v9.3.1.

**Code Editor/Integrated Development Environment**

You will also need a code editor or IDE to make changes to the application. Feel free to use your favorite IDE. You may find it helpful for your IDE to have a built in terminal access as there may be command line operations to run in the workshops.

If you are searching for an IDE to use, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Getting started

To get a local copy of the project and to install dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-enterprise-ready-workshops.git
cd okta-enterprise-ready-workshops
npm ci
```

Next, seed the db with two users. Run the script below and you'll see the users and their passwords written to the command line:

```bash
npm run init-db
```

### Start the application

Start both the frontend and backend using the npm command below.

```bash
npm start
```

Access the Todo app at `localhost:3000`. You should see the following sign-in page:

You will sign-in using the email and password of one of the two users, which will navigate you to the Todo app where you can start adding, completing, and deleting todos.

### Call the API directly

Access the API at `localhost:3333` if you want to target specific API endpoints using a HTTP client.

You can also serve the API without the Todo app by running the following command:

```bash
npm run serve-api
```

### Manage the database

If you need to inspect the db, you can use Prisma Studio. Run the following command:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
